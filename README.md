# To-Do-Application

This application can help you to manage your time. 

In this app, you can add a task, a deadline for it, a project, a performer, etc. 
It is important to note that the many-to-many relationship is organized here, 
so a single task can have multiple performers and a performer can have multiple tasks.

The application was created using JavaFX, and MySQL was used to work with the database.
